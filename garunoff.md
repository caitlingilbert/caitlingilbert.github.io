## Turnout Dropoff in 2021 Georgia Senate Runoffs by Race and County

**Visualization Details:** 62% of Georgia voters (~2.5M) who participated in the 2018 general election (~3.9M) did not vote in the subsequent runoff election. Analyzing the dropoff in voting between the November 2020 presidential election and the 2021 runoffs in GA after the early voting period helped direct campaigns/voter outreach orgs' efforts before election day. Interactive maps shown in the animation used voter file and vote history data from the Georgia Secretary of State as of 1/2/21. Each map shows the percent of November voters who had not yet voted in the runoff, across every county with at least 500 coded voters of each race. The animation shows these county breakdowns for Black, AAPI, and Hispanic voters in Georgia. Plot was made using R (leaflet).
